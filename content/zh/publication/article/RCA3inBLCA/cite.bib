    abstract = { In patients with bladder cancer (BC), the association between ST3 β-galactoside α-2,3-sialyltransferase 5 (ST3GAL5) expression and clinical outcomes, particularly regarding muscle‑invasive disease, high tumor grade and prognosis, remain unknown. In the present study, the expression of ST3GAL5 and its association with clinical outcomes in patients with BC was analyzed using various public bioinformatics databases. The difference in ST3GAL5 expression between BC and healthy bladder tissues was also evaluated using data from the Oncomine database, The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differences in ST3GAL5 expression between muscle invasive BC (MIBC) and non‑muscle invasive BC (NMIBC), and high‑ and low‑grade BC were also analyzed. Furthermore, genes that were positively co‑expressed with ST3GAL5 in patients with BC were identified from the intersection between the Oncomine, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 and UALCAN databases. Enrichment analysis by Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Reactome pathway enrichment analyses and a gene‑concept network was performed using R package. Gene set enrichment analysis was also performed to assess the signaling pathways influenced by the high and low expression of ST3GAL5 in BC. The results indicated that ST3GAL5 expression was significantly lower in BC tissues compared with normal bladder tissues (P<0.05). Furthermore, ST3GAL5 expression in MIBC and high‑grade BC was significantly lower compared with NMIBC and low‑grade BC (P<0.05), respectively. The results from Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis result demonstrated that ST3GAL5 downregulation was associated with poor survival in patients with BC (P<0.05). Taken together, these findings suggested that ST3GAL5 may be considered as an anti‑oncogene in BC, could represent a potential predictive and prognostic biomarker for BC and may be a molecular target for tumor therapy.}
