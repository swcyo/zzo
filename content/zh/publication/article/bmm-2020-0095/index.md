abstract: Aim--To study the expression patterns and prognostic value of the m ⁶ A-associated regulators in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). Materials and methods--The mRNA expression and clinical data were downloaded from ‘The Cancer Genome Atlas database’. The m ⁶ A-associated variants were downloaded from m ⁶ AVar database, and combined with 14 common m ⁶ A regulators for subsequent analysis. One-way analysis of variance, univariate Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm were successively applied to obtain the ultimate regulators and prognostic model. Finally, consensus clustering, protein–protein interaction (PPI) and enrichment analysis were performed. Result-- Nine regulators were obtained. PRAD patients could be classified into two risk groups and subclasses with significant survival differences by the prognostic model and consensus clustering, respectively. Conclusion--All these nine regulators were related to prognosis in PRAD, and could be used as clinical biomarkers.
