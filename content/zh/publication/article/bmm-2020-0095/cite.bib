    abstract = { Aim: To study the expression patterns and prognostic value of the m6A-associated regulators in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). Materials \& methods: The mRNA expression and clinical data were downloaded from ‘The Cancer Genome Atlas database’. The m6A-associated variants were downloaded from m6AVar database, and combined with 14 common m6A regulators for subsequent analysis. One-way analysis of variance, univariate Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm were successively applied to obtain the ultimate regulators and prognostic model. Finally, consensus clustering, protein–protein interaction (PPI) and enrichment analysis were performed. Result: Nine regulators were obtained. PRAD patients could be classified into two risk groups and subclasses with significant survival differences by the prognostic model and consensus clustering, respectively. Conclusion: All these nine regulators were related to prognosis in PRAD, and could be used as clinical biomarkers. }
